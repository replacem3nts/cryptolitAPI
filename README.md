# üóùüìñ   CryptoLit   üìñüóù
CryptoLit is full-stack web application that challenges you to solve cryptograms of varying difficulties based on famous lines from English Literature. The application comes out of the box with 100 puzzles with three levels of difficulty, but can be customized to make crytograms from whatever text you like!

This repository is for the backend and is designed to be used in tandem with the frontend. This API can be used with a different frontend and if you'd like to customize the puzzles on a subject of your choice, this may be a good option to reflect that choice. You can find the frontend repository [here](https://github.com/replacem3nts/cryptolit).

## Getting Started üöÄ
These instructions will give you a step-by-step guide to get a copy of this project on your local machine to test, develop, or just solve puzzles. If you'd like to skip all that and just want to solve puzzles, a version of the web application is currently deployed [here]().

### Prerequisites üìã
The following software is required to run CryptoLit. In the 'Languages and Tools' section, there are links to sites that have instructions to install them.

```
ruby@v2.6.1 or higher
rails@6.0.2 or higher
pg@0.18 or higher
```
### Installation üìã
NOTE: Once you've installed the backend, you'll then need to install and run the frontend to use the web application. Once you've completed the below, follow the instructions on the frontend README which you can find [here](https://github.com/replacem3nts/cryptolit).

1. Clone this repository and navigate into the folder:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:your_username_here/cryptolitAPI.git
$ cd cryptolitAPI
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
$ bundle install
```

3. Create the database, migrate, and seed the data:
```
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:seed
```

4. Make sure PostgreSQL is running, then start the server:
```
$ rails server
```

5. If you have not yet cloned the frontend, click this [link](https://github.com/replacem3nts/cryptolit) and follow the instructions.

## Domain Model üó∫
The backend models are relatively straightforward. The key aspect is that the puzzles are unencoded text with an author and source, which means that users primarily interact with challenges that are created with a unique encoding and solvekey.

## Customizing Puzzles üó∫
Due to the setup of the Domain Model, it's very straightforward to implement your own unique puzzles. Once you've completed the installation instructions above, follow these steps if you'd like to customize the puzzles:
1. If your rails server is running stop it by hitting 'ctrl' + 'c'

2. In your code editor, open the 'seeds.rb' file within the 'db' folder.

3. As you can see from the below code snippet, the seed format is relatively simple. Replace any or all of the seeds in the file with your own.
```
Puzzle.create(content: "WHATEVER TEXT YOU LIKE", author: "AUTHORS NAME", source: "SOURCE", difficulty: 1)
```

4. Reset the database, migrate and reseed.
```
$ rails db:reset
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:seed
```

5. Restart your server and begin solving!
```
$ rails server
```

## Solution Checking ‚úîÔ∏é
What follows is an overview of the process that happens when a user opens a new puzzle and later wants to check an answer:
1. The user selects a difficulty level and clicks 'Get a New Puzzle' which submits a fetch with the user_id and difficulty level to the backend.
2. The challenges controller calls on the 'Randomizer' PORO which chooses a random puzzle_id that the user has not created a challenge from and creates a challenge.
3. The challenge model has a 'before_create' action that calls on the 'Cipher' PORO to encode the text of the puzzle (based on difficulty level) and create an encrypted solvekey. The cryptogram is then rendered using the challenge serializer.
4. The cryptogram is created by either rotation or reshuffling the aphabet to build a substitution cipher then render an encoded version of the text.
5. The solvekey is created by stripping characters and duplicate letters from the crypotgram, then encyrpting that string by running it through Digest::SHA256.
6. This manner of creating a solvekey means that in the frontend, the same process of stripping characters and duplicate letters can be used to send a short string to the backend. That string can then be run through the same Digest::SHA256 module and compared with the solvekey; if the two match, the solved field is flipped to true--which unlocks a custom method from the puzzle model allowing the solution to be exposed to the user, if the two don't match, an error message is returned to the front end.

Below is a diagrammatic representation of the process:
